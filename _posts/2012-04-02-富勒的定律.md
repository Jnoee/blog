在《财务自由.心灵富足》中，作者多次提到富勒博士(Buckminster Fuller)以及富勒的定律。
我很感兴趣查找了Buckminster Fuller的资料，可惜英文不佳，只是一些片段。

* 定律一：我服务的对象越多，我的效能就越高。

	The more people i work for the more effective i become.

* 定律二：决定本身会引出更多定律。

	The principle are disclosed by the decisions themselves.
	<!-- more -->

* 定律三：一体为复，至少为二。

	Unity is plural and at minimum TWO. Even zero, 0 is a plural.
	Arrow in side zero and outside zero, yingyang, cold hot.
	
	The words UP and DOWN have absolutely NO meaning.
	If you use the words UP and DOWN now, you are completely hooked bu the dark ages conspiracy!
	
	The proper words are IN and OUT. Out is any direction, IN is always point-able always specific.
	By using the words IN and OUT you come into a COMPLETELY NEW WORLD.
	
	You’re going to TUNE IN very much more then you’re ever done before, TUN-ABILITY.
	Sun set and sun rise is wrong!!!

* 定律四：六个正负自由度

	Someone wrote a book on this and influence NY Jail Management and New York Government save more then 10 billion.
	
	1. Axial Rotation 轴旋转
	2. Orbital Rotation 轨旋转
	3. Expansion/Contraction 内缩外张 (Breathing)
	4. Torque(twisting) 扭
	5. Inside -OUT ( Inside Outing )内往外番 (Kiss)
	6. Precession 偏向
	
	Things you’ve NEVER understand before you suddenly begun to understand, 
	once you understand - feel - Precession personally.
	Society is continually thinking the 180o-ness and practically nothing to lose.
	
	Much of Social behaviors that have NEVER been understand become completely understand once you understand / feel precession.
	Human want to know, tell me what is right what is wrong... World is a process of discovery.

我没有把更多的翻译引入进来，我想这些东西自己去理解可能更合适。
因为这些定律很抽象，每个人看到这些定律的时候都会有自己的想法，会联想。
而且我觉得这些定律的理解应该没有对错之分，因人而异。
就好像在说“太极生两仪，两仪生四象，四象生八卦”，你知道这到底在说什么吗？
而富勒本身，我觉得像鬼谷子。
